                        You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you post to the Services, and for any
                        consequences thereof. The Content you submit, post, or display will be able to be viewed by other users
                        of the Services and through third party services and websites. You should only provide Content that you
                        are comfortable sharing with others under these Terms.<br><br>
                        Real estate and lending professionals may provide information to consumers via the Services or, where
                        authorized, take actions on behalf of a consumer client (e.g., post a home for sale). Without limitation,
                        lending professionals and institutions are prohibited from using the Services in making any loan-related
                        decisions. Subject to the restrictions set forth in the following paragraphs, you may copy information

                        information. You agree otherwise not to reproduce, modify, distribute, display or otherwise provide
                        access to, decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer any portion of the Services. Notwithstanding the
                        foregoing, the aggregate level data provided on the Swiftli RE Local-Info Pages, and available via http
                        download upon request, (the “Aggregate Data”) may be used for non-personal uses, eg. real estate
                        market analysis. You may display and distribute derivative works of the Aggregate Data (eg. within a
                        graph), so long as Swiftli RE is cited as a source.<br><br>
                        If you are accepting these Terms and using the Services on behalf of a company, organization,
                        government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so. You may

                        by Swiftli RE on the Services are subject to change. In consideration for Swiftli RE granting you access to
                        and use of the Services, you agree that Swiftli RE and its third party providers and partners may place
                        such advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of Content or information from the

                        You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Services and for any
                        activities or actions under your password. We encourage you to use "strong" passwords (passwords that

                    <li><b>Restrictions and Additional Terms</b><br><br>
                        You agree not to remove or modify any copyright or other intellectual property notices that appear in
                        the Services. You will not use the Services for resale, service bureau, time-sharing or other similar

                        ("Search Engines") may query the Services and provide an index with links to the Services' Web pages,
                        only to the extent such unlicensed "fair use" is allowed by applicable copyright law. Search Engines are
                        not permitted to query or search information protected by a security verification system ("captcha")

                        providers, or other third parties, such as real estate agents and mortgage brokers. Some of the numbers
                        listed may be routed through a third party service ("Calling Service"). Calls through the Calling Service
                        may be recorded or monitored for quality assurance and customer service purposes. In the event that
                        you make a call to Swiftli RE or through a Calling Service, you consent to such recording and monitoring.
                        Swiftli REwill treat recorded calls in accordance with its Privacy Policy.

                        mislabeled or are otherwise deceptive. Under no circumstances will Swiftli RE be liable in any way for
                        any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage

                        warranty, (c) negligence, or (d) any other cause of action, to the extent such exclusion
                        and limitations are not prohibited by applicable law. if you do not agree with any part
                        of these terms of use, or you have any dispute or claim against swiftli reor its suppliers

                        export laws, rules and regulations. All Services used by the U.S. or Canadian Governments are provided
                        with the commercial license rights described herein. If any part of these Terms of Use is determined to
                        be invalid or unenforceable, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be replaced with a valid,

                        with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive its right to act with respect to subsequent or
                        similar breaches. Except as expressly stated herein, these Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement
